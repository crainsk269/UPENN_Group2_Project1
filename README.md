###### 1) Is there a relationship between Total Shots on Target and Total Goals scored.
######    For this question I ran a regression of Total Shots on Target for the top 9 teams compared to Total Goals to see if teams with higher shots on Target scored more  goals. Simple answer yes. The more shots a team put on target the more goals they scored.


###### 2) What is the shot accuracy for each team Home & Away and were teams more accurate at home or away.
######    I wanted to see among the top 9 teams their shot accuracy home vs their Shot Accuracy Away. And only 2 teams had a higher shot accuracy at home while 7 had a  higher             shot accuracy away from home. I went into this question expecting teams to be more accurate at home but found the opposite to be true as more teams were accurate away           from home.
