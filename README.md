### Questions
###### 1) Is there a relationship between Total Shots on Target and Total Goals scored.
######    For this question I ran a regression of Total Shots on Target for the top 9 teams compared to Total Goals to see if teams with higher shots on Target scored more  goals. Simple answer yes. The more shots a team put on target the more goals they scored.


###### 2) What is the shot accuracy for each team Home & Away and were teams more accurate at home or away.
######    I wanted to see among the top 9 teams their shot accuracy home vs their Shot Accuracy Away. And only 2 teams had a higher shot accuracy at home while 7 had a  higher             shot accuracy away from home. I went into this question expecting teams to be more accurate at home but found the opposite to be true as more teams were accurate away           from home.
### Tasks
######  Ryan - 
######  Renamed Columns for csv Data, Ran regression and Accuracy analysis, worked on Goolge Presentation. Helped with GitHub trouble shooting.

### Issues
###### As a Group the biggest challenges we ran into was with GitHub and making sure we were not messing with anyones work. Individually we were all adept at the coding and programing aspect. Each member was able to run there own indivdual analysis with little issue. When it came to merging and collaborating with GitHub we found oursleves more confused from it than anything. The biggest question was always, 'Whats gonna happen to the braches when I push/pull/commit" etc. We were able to trouble shoot and resolve the issue in our own way.
