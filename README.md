## English Premier League Statistics

### Questions:

#### 1. Does home advantage field contribute to more goals scored?
####    Typically, one would think that home field advantage plays a significant role in the home team's performace. This showed to be true for the top nine teams selected for this study. Of the nine teams, seven of them had a scoring ratio of 2-to-1 while one of the teams had a scoring ratio of more than 3-to-1 against the visiting teams.

#### 2. Does being the visiting team contribute to less goals scored?
####    While the visiting team often faces challenges, our study showed that four of the top nine teams actually scored more goals than their home team opponent did. So while being the home team does have some advantages, it does not necessarily guarantee that they will outperform their visiting opponent.
