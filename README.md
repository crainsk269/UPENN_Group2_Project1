### Questions
###### 1) Is there a relationship between Total Shots on Target and Total Goals scored.
######    For this question I ran a regression of Total Shots on Target for the top 9 teams compared to Total Goals to see if teams with higher shots on Target scored more  goals. Simple answer yes. The more shots a team put on target the more goals they scored.


###### 2) What is the shot accuracy for each team Home & Away and were teams more accurate at home or away.
######    I wanted to see among the top 9 teams their shot accuracy home vs their Shot Accuracy Away. And only 2 teams had a higher shot accuracy at home while 7 had a  higher             shot accuracy away from home. I went into this question expecting teams to be more accurate at home but found the opposite to be true as more teams were accurate away           from home.
### Tasks
######  Ryan - 
######  Renamed Columns for csv Data, Ran regression and Accuracy analysis, worked on Goolge Presentation. Helped with GitHub trouble shooting.

### Issues
###### As a Group the biggest challenges we ran into was with GitHub and making sure we were not messing with anyones work. Individually we were all adept at the coding and programing aspect. Each member was able to run there own indivdual analysis with little issue. When it came to merging and collaborating with GitHub we found oursleves more confused from it than anything. The biggest question was always, 'Whats gonna happen to the braches when I push/pull/commit" etc. We were able to trouble shoot and resolve the issue in our own way.

### Questions
###### 1)   How does the age of a player affect their performance metrics, such as goals scored or assists made?
######      I compared the ages of players compared to how many goals they've scored.


###### 2)   What is the correlation between a players passing accuracy and their goals scored?
######      Another graph comparing the ages of players compared to a groups average passing rate.

### Tasks
###### Chris -
###### Collected data and made a dataset that could be worked with. Ran comparitive Bar Graph Analyses.

## Samuel

### Questions
###### 1. Does home advantage field contribute to more goals scored?
######    Typically, one would think that home field advantage plays a significant role in the home team's performace. This showed to be true for the top nine teams selected for this study. Of the nine teams, seven of them had a scoring ratio of 2-to-1 while one of the teams had a scoring ratio of more than 3-to-1 against the visiting teams.

###### 2. Does being the visiting team contribute to less goals scored?
######    While the visiting team often faces challenges, our study showed that four of the top nine teams actually scored more goals than their home team opponent did. So while being the home team does have some advantages, it does not necessarily guarantee that they will outperform their visiting opponent.

### Tasks
###### Samuel -
###### Created Slack group chat; suggested data analysis for teams who played in all 10 years which the dataset covered; ran data analysis for top nine teams for home, away, and total stats.
